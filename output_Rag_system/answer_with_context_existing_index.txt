### Steps for Risk Identification and Risk Management within the PMI Framework

#### 1. **Risk Identification**
   - **Methodologies**: 
     - Brainstorming sessions with project stakeholders.
     - Interviews with team members and subject matter experts.
     - Checklists based on previous projects or industry standards.
     - SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
   - **Tools**:
     - **Issue Log**: Review for existing issues that may indicate potential risks.
     - **Lessons Learned Register**: Utilize insights from past projects to identify risks that may recur.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Conduct risk workshops to facilitate discussions and gather diverse perspectives.
     - Regularly update the **Risk Register** with newly identified risks, including details such as risk owners and potential impacts.

#### 2. **Risk Assessment**
   - **Qualitative Risk Analysis**: 
     - Assess the probability and impact of identified risks.
     - Categorize risks based on their severity and likelihood.
     - Use probability and impact scales to prioritize risks.
   - **Quantitative Risk Analysis** (if applicable): 
     - Perform numerical analysis to determine the potential impact on project objectives.
   - **Tools**:
     - **Risk Report**: Analyze current project risk exposure and strategies for major risks.

#### 3. **Risk Analysis**
   - **Methodologies**:
     - Use of risk matrices to visualize and prioritize risks.
     - Scenario analysis to understand the implications of risks on project objectives.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Involve a skilled facilitator in risk workshops to enhance discussions and ensure all risks are considered.

#### 4. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
   - **Developing Response Plans**:
     - Assign risk owners responsible for planning and implementing responses.
     - Identify and document risk mitigation strategies tailored to each risk.
   - **Types of Strategies**:
     - Avoidance: Alter project plans to eliminate the risk.
     - Mitigation: Implement actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
     - Transfer: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
     - Acceptance: Acknowledge the risk and prepare to manage its consequences if it occurs.

#### 5. **Risk Monitoring**
   - **Continuous Monitoring**:
     - Regularly review and update the **Risk Register** to reflect changes in risk status and new risks.
     - Monitor the effectiveness of risk responses and adjust strategies as necessary.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Schedule periodic risk review meetings to assess the current risk landscape.
     - Utilize performance metrics to track the impact of risks on project objectives.

By following these steps and utilizing the outlined methodologies, tools, and best practices, project teams can effectively identify and manage risks within the PMI framework, ensuring a higher likelihood of project success.

Context used:
### Project Documents
Key documents to consider as inputs for this process include:
- **Issue Log**: Used to check for updates on open issues that might affect the risk register.
- **Lessons Learned Register**: Provides insights from past project phases that can influence monitoring activities.
- **Risk Register**: Contains key details such as identified risks, owners, agreed-upon responses, implementation actions, and assessment controls for response plans.
- **Risk Report**: Offers an assessment of current project risk exposure and strategies regarding major individual risks.
**2. Conducting Meetings for Qualitative Risk Analysis**  
To perform qualitative risk analysis, the project team may host specialized meetings known as risk workshops. The objectives of these meetings include reviewing previously identified risks, assessing their probabilities and impacts, and categorizing and prioritizing risks. Each identified risk is allocated a risk owner responsible for planning appropriate responses and reporting progress. The meeting may also involve familiarization with probability and impact scales, alongside identification of new risks. Employing a skilled facilitator can enhance the effectiveness of these discussions.
- **Initial Risk Addressing**: Risks are first addressed during project planning by shaping strategy.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: As the project progresses, continuous monitoring and management of risks are essential to keep the project on track and identify emerging risks.
