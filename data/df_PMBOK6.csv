they do this in a context of constraints and assumptions while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conﬂicting and changing
organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and rewardproject risk management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes
when unmanaged these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the deﬁned project objectives
consequently the effectiveness of project risk management is directly related to project successrisk exists at two levels within every project
each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives
it is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty
project risk management processes address both levels of risk in projects and these are deﬁned as follows conceptualise uuindividual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectivesuuoverall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome both positive and negativeindividual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur
project risk management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks while avoiding or mitigating negative risks 
unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay cost overruns performance shortfall or loss of reputation
opportunities that are captured can lead to beneﬁts such as reduced time and cost improved performance or reputationoverall project risk can also be positive or negative
management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation promoting drivers of positive variation and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives
part guiderisks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project so project risk management processes should be conducted iteratively
risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy
risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressedin order to manage risk effectively on a particular project the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives
this is deﬁned by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders
risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective
they are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the deﬁnitions of risk impact levels for the projecttrends and e mergi ng p racti ces i n project risk m anagementthe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered and that project risks are understood in a wider context
trends and emerging practices for project risk management include but are not limited to conceptualise uunon event risks
most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur
examples of event based risks include conceptualise a key seller may go out of business during the project the customer may change the requirement after design is complete or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processesthere is an increasing recognition that non event risks need to be identiﬁed and managed
there are two main types of non event risks conceptualise u nvariability risk
uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision
examples of variability risks include conceptualise productivity may be above or below target the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phaseu nambiguity risk
uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future
areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include conceptualise elements of the requirement or technical solution future developments in regulatory frameworks or inherent systemic complexity in the project
variability risks can be addressed using monte carlo analysis with the range of variation reﬂected in probability distributions followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes
ambiguity risks are managed by deﬁning those areas where there is a deﬁcit of knowledge or understanding then ﬁlling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices
ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development prototyping or simulationuuproject resilience
the existence of emergent risk is becoming clear with a growing awareness of so called unknowable unknowns
these are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred
emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience
this requires each project to have conceptualise u nright level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks in addition to a speciﬁc risk budget for known risksu nflexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project goals including strong change managementu nempowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed upon limitsu nfrequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible andu nclear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response to emergent risksuuintegrated risk management
projects exist in an organizational context and they may form part of a program or portfolio
risk exists at each of these levels and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level
some risks identiﬁed at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project
a coordinated approach to enterprise wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels
this builds risk efﬁciency into the structure of programs and portfolios providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure
part guidetailori ng c onsi dera tionsbecause each project is unique it is necessary to tailor the way project risk management processes are applied
considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to conceptualise uuproject size
does the project’s size in terms of budget duration scope or team size require a more detailed approach to risk management
or is it small enough to justify a simpliﬁed risk processuuproject complexity
is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation new technology commercial arrangements interfaces or external dependencies that increase project complexity
or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will sufﬁceuuproject importance
how strategically important is the project
is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities addresses signiﬁcant blocks to organizational performance or involves major product innovationuudevelopment approach
is this a waterfall project where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its executiontailoring of the project risk management processes to meet these considerations is part of the plan risk management process and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management planconsi dera tions for a gilead apti ve e nvironmentshigh variability environments by deﬁnition incur more uncertainty and risk
to address this projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed
risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration and risks will also be identiﬁed analyzed and managed during each iterationadditionally the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure
plan risk m anagementplan risk management is the process of deﬁning how to conduct risk management activities for a project
the key beneﬁt of this process is that it ensures that the degree type and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders
this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project

provide a means for grouping individual project risks
a common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk 
an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise
this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks
the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects or the project may develop a tailored rbs
where an rbs is not used an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives

extract from sample risk breakdown structure uustakeholder risk appetite
the risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan as they inform the details of the plan risk management process
in particular stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective
these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risksuudefinitions of risk probability and impacts
deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders
the project may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided by the organization
the number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach and fewer for a simple process 
table provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives
these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact deﬁnitions as negative for threats and positive for opportunities table

described in section  prioritization rules may be speciﬁed by the organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets or they may be tailored to the speciﬁc project
opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using positive deﬁnitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact deﬁnitions for threats
descriptive terms or numeric values can be used for probability and impact
where numeric values are used these can be multiplied to give a probability impact score for each risk which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level

participants in risk identiﬁcation activities may include the following conceptualise project manager project team members project risk specialist customers subject matter experts from outside the project team end users other project managers operations managers stakeholders and risk management experts within the organization
while these personnel are often key participants for risk identiﬁcation all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks
it is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for identiﬁed individual project risks the level of overall project risk and associated risk response actionswhen describing and recording individual project risks a consistent format should be used for risk statements to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response development
risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the identify risks process and will be conﬁrmed during the perform qualitative risk analysis process
preliminary risk responses may also be identiﬁed and recorded and will be reviewed and conﬁrmed as part of the plan risk responses processidentify risks is an iterative process since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change
the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identiﬁcation cycle will vary by situation and this will be deﬁned in the risk management plan

expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of similar projects or business areas
such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk based on their previous experience and areas of expertise
the experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process
data ga theringdata gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to conceptualise uubrainstorming
the goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk
the project team usually performs brainstorming often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team
ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator either in a free form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques
categories of risk such as in a risk breakdown structure can be used as a framework
particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formeduuchecklists
a checklist is a list of items actions or points to be considered
it is often used as a reminder
risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information
they are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project
the organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry
while a checklist may be quick and simple to use it is impossible to build an exhaustive one and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation
the project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist
additionally the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete informationuuinterviews
individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced project participants stakeholders and subject matter experts
interviews should be conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions
data analy sisdata analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to conceptualise uuroot cause analysis
root cause analysis is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem and develop preventive action
it can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring
the same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt statement and exploring which opportunities might result in that beneﬁt being realizeduuassumption and constraint analysis
every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints
these are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates
assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project
threats may be identiﬁed from the inaccuracy instability inconsistency or incompleteness of assumptions
constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or processuuswot analysis
this technique examines the project from each of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats perspectives
for risk identiﬁcation it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by including internally generated risks
the technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses of the organization focusing on either the project organization or the business area in general
swot analysis then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths and any threats resulting from weaknesses
the analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunitiesuudocument analysis
described in section  risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project documents including but not limited to plans assumptions constraints previous project ﬁles contracts agreements and technical documentation
uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents may be indicators of risk on the project
part guide int erpersonal and team s killsinterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation 
facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk
a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task follow the method associated with the technique accurately ensure clear risk descriptions identify and overcome sources of bias and resolve any disagreements that may arise
prompt l istsa prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk
the prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identiﬁcation techniques
the risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks
some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk for example pestle tecop or vuca 
meetin gsto undertake risk identiﬁcation the project team may conduct a specialized meeting 
most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming but other risk identiﬁcation techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan
use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting
it is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop
on larger projects it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor subject matter experts sellers representatives of the customer or other project stakeholders
risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team

perform qualitative risk analysis conceptualise data flow diagramperform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identiﬁed individual project risks using their probability of occurrence the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur and other factors
such assessments are subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders
effective assessment therefore requires explicit identiﬁcation and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process
risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identiﬁed risks so attention should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it
where a facilitator is used to support the perform qualitative risk analysis process addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role
an evaluation of the quality of the available information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk’s importance to the project
perform qualitative risk analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for plan risk responses
it identiﬁes a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring that it is implemented
perform qualitative risk analysis also lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis if this process is requiredthe perform qualitative risk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle as deﬁned in the risk management plan
often in an agile development environment the perform qualitative risk analysis process is conducted before the start of each iteration

the possibility of expert views being biased should be taken into account in this process
data ga theringdata ga thering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews
structured or semi structured interviews can be used to assess the probability and impacts of individual project risks as well as other factors
the interviewer should promote an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality in the interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased assessments
data analy sisdata analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to conceptualise uurisk data quality assessment
risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis
the use of low quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project
if data quality is unacceptable it may be necessary to gather better data
risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring the project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics which may include completeness objectivity relevancy and timeliness
a weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality scoreuurisk probability and impact assessment
risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a speciﬁc risk will occur
risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule cost quality or performance
impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities
probability and impact are assessed for each identiﬁed individual project risk
risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register
project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included
the level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting
differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected and such differences should be explored
explanatory detail including assumptions justifying the levels assigned are also recorded
risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the deﬁnitions given in the risk management plan 
risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part of a watch list for future monitoringuuassessment of other risk parameters
the project team may consider other characteristics of risk when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action
these characteristics may include but are not limited to conceptualise 
the period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective
a short period indicates high urgencyu nproximity
the period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives
a short period indicates high proximityu ndormancy
the period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered

the ease with which the results of the risk occurring or being about to occur can be detected and recognized
where the risk occurrence can be detected easily detectability is highu nconnectivity
the extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks
where a risk is connected to many other risks connectivity is highu nstrategic impact
the potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization’s strategic goals
where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals strategic impact is highu npropinquity
the degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders
where a risk is perceived as very signiﬁcant propinquity is highthe consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible by only assessing probability and impact
int erpersonal and team s killsinterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation 
facilitation improves the effectiveness of the qualitative analysis of individual project risks
a skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk analysis task follow the method associated with the technique accurately reach consensus on assessments of probability and impacts identify and overcome sources of bias and resolve any disagreements that may arise
risk ca tegorizationrisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk  see figure  the area of the project affected  see figures and  or other useful categories to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty
risks can also be categorized by common root causes
risk categories that may be used for the project are deﬁned in the risk management plangrouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and effort on the areas of highest risk exposure or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks
data representa tiondata representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to conceptualise uuprobability and impact matrix
a probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs
this matrix speciﬁes combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups 
risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts
the probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact on one or more project objectives if it does occur using deﬁnitions of probability and impact for the project as speciﬁed in the risk management plan
individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their assessed probability and impact using a probability and impact matrixan organization can assess a risk separately for each objective by having a separate probability and impact matrix for each
alternatively it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level for each risk either by combining assessments for different objectives or by taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affecteduuhierarchical charts
where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters the probability and impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required
for example a bubble chart displays three dimensions of data where each risk is plotted as a disk and the three parameters are represented by the x axis value the y axis value and the bubble size
an example bubble chart is shown in figure with detectability and proximity plotted on the x and y axes and impact value represented by bubble size
example bubble chart showing detectability proximity and impact value meetin gsto undertake qualitative risk analysis the project team may conduct a specialized meeting dedicated to the discussion of identiﬁed individual project risks
the goals of this meeting include the review of previously identiﬁed risks assessment of probability and impacts categorization and prioritization
a risk owner who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting progress on managing the risk will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the perform qualitative risk analysis process
the meeting may start by reviewing and conﬁrming the probability and impact scales to be used for the analysis
the meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion and these should be recorded for analysis

perform quantitative risk analysis conceptualise data flow diagramperform quantitative risk analysis is not required for all projects
undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability of high quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty as well as a sound underlying project baseline for scope schedule and cost
quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise in the development and interpretation of risk models
it also consumes additional time and cost
the use of quantitative risk analysis for a project will be speciﬁed in the project’s risk management plan
it is most likely appropriate for large or complex projects strategically important projects projects for which it is a contractual requirement or projects in which a key stakeholder requires it
quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertaintyperform quantitative risk analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the perform qualitative risk analysis process as having a signiﬁcant potential to affect the project’s objectivesoutputs from perform quantitative risk analysis are used as inputs to the plan risk responses process particularly in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks
a quantitative risk analysis may also be undertaken following the plan risk responses process to determine the likely effectiveness of planned responses in reducing overall project risk exposure

part guide data ga theringinterviews may be used to generate inputs for the quantitative risk analysis drawing on inputs that include individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty
this is particularly useful where information is required from experts
the interviewer should promote an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality during the interview to encourage honest and unbiased contributions
int erpersonal and team s killsinterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation 
a skilled facilitator is useful for gathering input data during a dedicated risk workshop involving project team members and other stakeholders
facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a clear understanding of the purpose of the workshop building consensus among participants ensuring continued focus on the task and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conﬂict or sources of bias
representa tions of unc ertaintyquantita tive risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reﬂect individual project risks and other sources of uncertaintywhere the duration cost or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain the range of possible values can be represented in the model as a probability distribution
this may take several forms
the most commonly used are triangular normal lognormal beta uniform or discrete distributions
care should be taken when selecting an appropriate probability distribution to reﬂect the range of possible values for the planned activityindividual project risks may be covered by probability distributions
alternatively risks may be included in the model as probabilistic branches where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time andor cost impact of the risk should it occur and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk’s probability
branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned activity
where risks are related for example with a common cause or a logical dependency correlation is used in the model to indicate this relationshipother sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through the project
data analy sisdata analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to conceptualise uusimulation
quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives
simulations are typically performed using a monte carlo analysis
when running a monte carlo analysis for cost risk the simulation uses the project cost estimates
when running a monte carlo analysis for schedule risk the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used
an integrated quantitative cost schedule risk analysis uses both inputs
the output is a quantitative risk analysis modelcomputer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times
the input values are chosen at random for each iteration
outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project 
typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a particular outcome resulted from the simulation or a cumulative probability distribution representing the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less

part guidefor a quantitative schedule risk analysis it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path
a criticality index is calculated for each element in the risk model which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path during the simulation usually expressed as a percentage
the output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the projectuusensitivity analysis
sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes
it correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis modelone typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram which presents the calculated correlation coefﬁcient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome
this can include individual project risks project activities with high degrees of variability or speciﬁc sources of ambiguity
items are ordered by descending strength of correlation giving the typical tornado appearance
an example tornado diagram is shown in figure figure

decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action
alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks 
the end points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path which can be negative or positivethe decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch allowing the optimal path to be selected

inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty
an inﬂuence diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities outcomes and inﬂuences together with the relationships and effects between them
where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty this can be represented in the inﬂuence diagram using ranges or probability distributions
the inﬂuence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique such as monte carlo analysis to indicate which elements have the greatest inﬂuence on key outcomes
outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods including s curves and tornado diagrams

plan risk responses conceptualise data flow diagram effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats maximize individual opportunities and reduce overall project risk exposure
unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect
once risks have been identiﬁed analyzed and prioritized plans should be developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every individual project risk the project team considers to be sufﬁciently important either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers
the project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to the current level of overall project riskrisk responses should be appropriate for the signiﬁcance of the risk cost effective in meeting the challenge realistic within the project context agreed upon by all parties involved and owned by a responsible person
selecting the optimal risk response from several options is often required
the strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective should be selected for each risk
structured decision making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate response
for large or complex projects it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategiesspeciﬁc actions are developed to implement the agreed upon risk response strategy including primary and backup strategies as necessary
a contingency plan can be developed for implementation if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs
secondary risks should also be identiﬁed
secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response
a contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost
if developed it may include identiﬁcation of the conditions that trigger its use

a skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk identify and compare alternative possible risk response strategies choose an appropriate response strategy and identify and overcome sources of bias
st rategies f or threatsfive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats as follows conceptualise uuescalate
escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority
escalated risks are managed at the program level portfolio level or other relevant part of the organization and not on the project level
the project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization
it is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization
threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat occurred
escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation although they may be recorded in the risk register for information
risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact
it may be appropriate for high priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact
avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely reducing its probability of occurrence to zero
the risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur
examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat extending the schedule changing the project strategy or reducing scope
some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements obtaining information improving communication or acquiring expertiseuutransfer
transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs
risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat
transfer can be achieved by a range of actions which include but are not limited to the use of insurance performance bonds warranties guarantees etc
agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for speciﬁed risks to another partyuumitigate
in risk mitigation action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence andor impact of a threat
early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred
adopting less complex processes conducting more tests or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions
mitigation may involve prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench scale model of a process or product
where it is not possible to reduce probability a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity
for example designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original componentuuaccept
risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat but no proactive action is taken
this strategy may be appropriate for low priority threats and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost effective to address a threat in any other way
acceptance can be either active or passive
the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve including amounts of time money or resources to handle the threat if it occurs
passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly
part guide st rategies f or oppor tunitiesfive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities as follows conceptualise uuescalate
this risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority
escalated opportunities are managed at the program level portfolio level or other relevant part of the organization and not on the project level
the project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization
it is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization
opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred
escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation although they may be recorded in the risk register for informationuuexploit
the exploit strategy may be selected for high priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized
this strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens increasing the probability of occurrence to 
examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and durationuushare
sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs
it is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project
risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity
examples of sharing actions include forming risk sharing partnerships teams special purpose companies or joint venturesuuenhance
the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability andor impact of an opportunity
early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the beneﬁt after the opportunity has occurred
the probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes
where it is not possible to increase probability an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential beneﬁt
examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to ﬁnish earlyuuaccept
accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken
this strategy may be appropriate for low priority opportunities and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost effective to address an opportunity in any other way
acceptance can be either active or passive
the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve including amounts of time money or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs
passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly
conting ent re spons e st rategiessome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur
for some risks it is appropriate for the project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predeﬁned conditions if it is believed that there will be sufﬁcient warning to implement the plan
events that trigger the contingency response such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller should be deﬁned and tracked
risk responses identiﬁed using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identiﬁed triggering events that set the plans in effect
st rategies f or overall project riskrisk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall project risk
the same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk conceptualise uuavoid
where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly negative and outside the agreed upon risk thresholds for the project an avoid strategy may be adopted
this involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds
an example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high risk elements of scope from the project
where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds the project may be canceled
this represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is and will remain unacceptableuuexploit
where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly positive and outside the agreed upon risk thresholds for the project an exploit strategy may be adopted
this involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole
an example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition of high beneﬁt elements of scope to the project to add value or beneﬁts to stakeholders
alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modiﬁed with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunityuutransfershare
if the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization
where overall project risk is negative a transfer strategy is required which may involve payment of a risk premium
in the case of high positive overall project risk ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated beneﬁts
examples of both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk launching a joint venture or special purpose company or subcontracting key elements of the project
these strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving the project’s objectives
the mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative and enhancement applies when it is positive
examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project changing the scope and boundaries of the project modifying project priority changing resource allocations adjusting delivery times etcuuaccept
where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently deﬁned even if overall project risk is outside the agreed upon thresholds
acceptance can be either active or passive
the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project including amounts of time money or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds
passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly
data analy sisa number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered
data analysis techniques that can be used to select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to conceptualise uualternatives analysis
a simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriateuucost benefit analysis
if the impact of an individual project risk can be quantiﬁed in monetary terms then the cost effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost beneﬁt analysis 
the ratio of divided by gives the cost effectiveness of the response strategy with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response
decision makingdecision making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to multicriteria decision analysis 
one or more risk response strategies may be under consideration
decision making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies
multicriteria decision analysis uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria evaluating and ranking alternatives and selecting a preferred option
criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to cost of response likely effectiveness of response in changing probability andor impact resource availability timing constraints level of impact if the risk occurs effect of response on related risks introduction of secondary risks etc
different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves to be ineffective

part guideproper attention to the implement risk responses process will ensure that agreed upon risk responses are actually executed
a common problem with project risk management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and analyzing risks and developing risk responses then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register and risk report but no action is taken to manage the riskonly if risk owners give the required level of effort to implementing the agreed upon responses will the overall risk exposure of the project and individual threats and opportunities be managed proactively

throughout execution of the project some individual project risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or schedule contingency reserves
reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate
this may be communicated using various graphical representations including a burndown chart
auditsdescribed in section  risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the risk management process
the project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency as deﬁned in the project’s risk management plan
risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings or may form part of a risk review meeting or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings
the format for the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly deﬁned before the audit is conducted
meetin gsmeetings that can be used during this process include but are not limited to risk reviews
risk reviews are scheduled regularly and should examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk and with identiﬁed individual project risks
risk reviews may also result in identiﬁcation of new individual project risks reassessment of current risks the closing of risks that are outdated issues that have arisen as the result of risks that have occurred and identiﬁcation of lessons to be learned for implementation in ongoing phases in the current project or in similar projects in the future
